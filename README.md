## Architecture

The Application is split into a three layer architecture in order to provide clean separation of concerns .
- Data - Layer that holds APIs, Database, Cache
- Domain - Layer that holds Use Cases, and Model Objects. Business logic happens here.
- Application - Layer that holds presentation, Android components, Viewmodels, Dagger components/modules handles Dependency Injection, etc. MVVM exists at this layer.
